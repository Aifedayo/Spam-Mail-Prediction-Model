## Overview
The **Spam Mail Prediction Model** leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify emails. The model was trained on labeled datasets of spam and ham emails, enabling it to recognize common patterns associated with spam.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization techniques.
- **Modeling**: Machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluated using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
